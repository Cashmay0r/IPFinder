# Frontend Mentor - IP address tracker solution

This is a solution to the [IP address tracker challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/ip-address-tracker-I8-0yYAH0). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

This is a small project that I developed. I used Frontend Mentor for the project idea, they provided me with some design pages for both mobile and and desktop designs, both should be present in the design folder. They also provided me with some requirements and API's to use to complete the task.

The idea of the project was to make a simple webpage that would allow the user to enter an IP address and then the IP would used with an IP Geolocation API and the data I recieved back will be displayed to the user. A map is also included which redirects and pins the location of the IP address once the IP address data is received from the API.

The Design content (Images), images and some small bits of information like the font-family used, etc, was provided to me by FrontEnd Mentor and the rest of the website was developed by myself using HTML, CSS and JS aswell as the IP Geolocation API and LeafletJS for implementing the maps.
